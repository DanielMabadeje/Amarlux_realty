              <p className="intr_tarry">
                Though Tarrytown is relaxed and big on small-town feels,
                community get-togethers are a must in this neighborhood. People
                are friendly and enjoy relaxing in the company of one another
                after a long day or week or work or learning at school. Sporting
                events, days at the park, parades, and fundraisers prompt people
                to coalesce consistently. People retreat to their homes here
                when solitude is desired, and export to the surrounding busier
                areas when it’s time to liven things up or spend a night on the
                town.

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                Convenience isn’t far in Tarrytown, so the peaceful vibe isn’t
                sacrificed for anything else. Places like the Tarrytown Pharmacy
                keep all of the necessities at residents fingertips. Quaint
                cafes such as Mozart’s Coffee Roasters fuel customers with
                delectable blends of coffee and tea. A prized characteristic of
                Mozart’s is the view overlooking Lake Austin, which is perfect
                for watching the sun rise or set as you enjoy a fresh artisan
                coffee, pastry, or tea.
                <br />
                <br />
                For dinner, locals would strongly urge a visit to Hula Hut. A
                melding of Tex-Mex and Polynesian cuisine, creative and colorful
                dishes here line the menu. Of course, accompanied by lake views,
                a meal here is a wonderful fusion of Austin charm and an
                otherworldly taste palette.

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                For all of its quiet and serene aura, Tarrytown offers equal
                artistic flair. The Laguna Gloria displays contemporary art in a
                beautiful home, giving it a cozy feel. The house was formerly
                owned by Clara Driscoll and is now laden with art, inside and
                out. Most of the art focuses on being fun and whimsical,
                especially sculpture pieces that adorn the front lawn.
                <br />
                <br />
                More often than not, the weather in the area is warm and
                outdoor-worthy. When in need of aquatic fun, head down to the
                Deep Eddy Municipal Pool. Featuring a bathhouse and pools for
                both lap and leisure swimming, locals flock to this pool to stay
                cool in the sweltering heat.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fun on dry land is possible too, commonly had at Reed
                Neighborhood Park. Hiking, running, and walking are common
                activities due to the beautiful trails that snake their way
                through the park. The common lawn is often used for picnicking
                or star gazing in the evenings. Occasionally movies are also
                hosted on the large main lawn, projected on a screen as viewers
                lounge on blankets as they watch.
