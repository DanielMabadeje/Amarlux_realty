                Since 1953 this beautiful private suburb has been the talk of
                the Austin neighborhoods. Hilly terrain accompanied by massive
                trees and beautiful chirping birds transport residents to a
                world that feels as if it’s a world away from Austin’s bustling
                downtown core. Conveniently, it’s a mere six miles away.

                that prize privacy and luxury to be near the fun of a big city
                without being centered in all the action. Westlake real estate
                tends to sell fast. Contact Austin real estate agent & realtor,
                Kumara Wilcoxon to find luxury property, houses & waterfront

                <br />
                Families flock to Westlake, enticed by the large estate-style
                homes that allow children and pets to roam freely and enjoy the
                outdoors. The neighborhood is spread out over four square miles
                and is known for maintaining its high-level independence,
                keeping itself separate from the rest of the esteemed city that
                has been erected around it. Members of the community are
                friendly and mingle when time allows. It’s common for mornings
                and days to be lively in this family-oriented space. Daylight
                hours seem to be preferred, as the nights are commonly quieter
                and more relaxed. Time of day aside, amenities are plenty and
                the ease of commute adds to the perfected feeling of the
                beautiful West Lake Hills.

              </p>
              <p className="intr_tarry">
                Westlake is very much a residential area, through and through.
                The movement here is purposeful, centered on going places or
                getting things done. People head to nearby areas of Austin for
                errands, work, school, and fun. You’ll see kids playing outdoors
                with one another or their pets within the community. Strolling
                the hills is great exercise and a common pastime for many here.
                Evenings are quiet and perfect for relaxing alone or with family
                among the stunning Texas starry skies.

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                Westlake only feels tucked away; anything you could imagine you
                might need is still very close by. A scrumptious meal can be had
                at Sway, the local Thai restaurant. Dishes served atop handmade
                noodles and artisan rice are cooked in the traditional Thai
                fashion of being extremely flavorful–and spicy if you like.
                Since residents of Westlake love morning and daytime, Blue
                Dahlia Bistro is a notable choice for traditional European
                Bistro-style breakfast, lunch, and coffee.

                <br />
                Shop at the Village at Westlake, the choice spot for clothing
                shopping, gym activity, or more luxe errands such as manicures
                and pedicures at Magnolia Nails and Spa. The location of the
                shops is ideal for when shopping is desired, but in a more quiet
                area than the shops in the busy nearby downtown.

              <p className="community_header_welcome text-left">THINGS TO DO</p>
              <p className="intr_tarry">
                Westlake is home to no shortage of family pets. Dog lovers adore
                the neighborhood and the Red Bud Isle is an amazing prized
                possession of the neighborhood. Spread out over an expansive 13
                acres, this dog park even features lake access for pups who
                don’t mind doggy paddling through the cool waters.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are parks geared toward humans, too, with the main
                favorite being Zilker Park. Spanning over 350 acres, Zilker is
                known to be the top park in all of Austin, not just Westlake.
                Featuring sites for picnicking, volleyball, disc golf, and even
                the Austin Nature and Science Center, it’s easy to see why the
                park is well populated year-round. If watersports are your
                preferred activity, go paddle boarding off Stratford in the
                beautiful Lady Bird Lake. Hourly rentals for kayaks and stand-up
                paddleboards will keep your free time filled with memorable
                aquatic fun.
