                Conveniently close to both uptown Austin and downtown, the
                atmosphere manages to be substantially different. Known for
                being a tad quieter and laidback, many professionals and
                families choose the area as a great spot for achieving a quick
                commute while still having perks like large front and back
                lawns. The weather is wonderful year-round, rarely warranting
                anything more than a light jacket. So, trees, flowers, and
                grasses look effortlessly impeccable, giving the area a paradise
                feel.
