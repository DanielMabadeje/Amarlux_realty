                South of downtown Austin, you can find Travis Heights. This
                urban community was made possible by the bridges over the
                Colorado River, which connect it to the bustling city on the
                other side. Development in the 1920s led to the area’s growth
                and today, it’s a hip area populated by young professionals
                starting their lives and optimizing their success, all while
                soaking up all the fun the area has to offer.

                Mainly populated by youthful residents, this reflects in the
                modern design of the expansive homes that line streets with
                beautiful oak trees. Older homes have been restored to blend
                contemporary and antique. Travis Heights real estate is in high
                demand. Contact Austin real estate agent & realtor, Kumara
                Wilcoxon to find property, condos, houses & luxury homes for

                Geometric architecture, hip color palettes, large windows, and
                curved walkways are common finds of the homes in the area. A
                stroll down neighborhood streets is fun and winding, with many
                roads curving to fit the unique layout of the community.
                Depending on the specific location, it’s easy to walk across to
                downtown Austin in just a few minutes. Life here is an
                interesting mix of urban and suburban. Not quite as busy as
                downtown, but not as quiet as nearby areas like Old West Austin,
                it’s an area in a class all its own.
