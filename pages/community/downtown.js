                History, fun, and luxury come alive in this trendy urban city.
                Consistently warm temperatures mix with a lively atmosphere to
                create space residents and visitors rave about. Homeowners here
                take pride in townhomes, condominiums, and penthouses that can
                be either antique or newly built. Modern homes don fun and fresh
                updates that create a best-of-both-worlds feel. Newer builds
                often feature pristine architecture and panoramic views from
                high floors. The appeal of living in this downtown Texas city
                lies heavily in the extensive convenience, fun, and suave,
                cosmopolitan feel.
                <br />
                <br />A walk through Downtown Austin’s moderately busy streets
                will expose you to students, visitors, and businesspeople
                passing through. People are focused but maintain a friendly
                persona when interacting with them, mixing small-town and
                big-city feels. Staying true to its energized, productive
                personality, the city is full of beloved cafes, coworking
                spaces, and office buildings. When the workday is done, people
                retire to local hangouts or homes for relaxation, fun, or a
                combination of both.

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                Downtown Austin packs life, energy, and fun into the lives of
                those who inhabit the city. Living here or commuting to it
                frequently places you among fun-loving people who thrive in the
                robust offerings the city has to offer. Since it’s home to many
                lucrative businesses, philanthropists, creatives, and students,
                mornings are lively in preparation for the successful day ahead.
                Afternoons tend to be quieter as focus time ensues, a person
                here and there heading out for a mid-day coffee or some lunch
                break fare. Nighttime is where the city truly flourishes, people
                come out in droves to take part in local events, grab drinks or
                stretch their legs with a walk through their favorite part of
                town.

                Variety seems to be neverending when searching for a place to
                eat, shop or make memories here. Navigating Downtown Austin has
                been put down to a science as it is simply split into six main
                districts. The Rainey Street District ranks as the district
                offering the most favored options for places to grab a bite.
                Should you only have to pick one must-visit restaurant in the
                area, your taste buds are best exposed to the dishes at either
                Geraldine’s or Emmer and Rye. Both are highly ranked area
                favorites, serving up high-class fusion cuisine in beautiful
                settings.
                <br />
                <br />
                You could also head for whimsical and classic drinks and French
                cuisine at Small Victory or Peche. Either option offers detailed
                and beautiful interior decor, perfect for getting inspired while
                you sip your cocktail and socialize. Classic Italian fare can be
                had at Sammie’s. Truly in classic fashion, the walls don
                pictures of Italy and family portraits while handmade pasta is
                served atop white table cloths, fine china, and crystalline wine
                glasses.
                <br />
                <br />
                Freetime puts you at the mercy of all the possibilities Downtown
                Austin has to offer. Socialites adore the vast options for
                nightlife, often heading to The White Horse, an amped-up
                nighttime club that fuels dancers with great music, tacos, and
                handcrafted cocktails. Austin City Limits Live is yet another
                great option for live music, drawing huge crowds year-round.
                Famous bands, singers, and shows frequent the venue.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whether you’re just visiting or need to relax at a lavish spa,
                your best choice is the Austin Proper Hotel. Ranked as the #1
                hotel in the city, guests rave over the beautiful interior decor
                and impeccable customer service. Shopping is as much an
                adventure as a night out here. Scattered around the city you can
                find stores like Free People, and Luxe Apothetique. All styles
                are catered to at the shops around the city, aptly reflecting
                the various tastes of the residents.

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                This list could easily go on forever due to everyone in Downtown
                Austin loving to keep busy and have fun. Bask in the fresh air
                at Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail and Boardwalk at Lady
                Bird Lake, with year-round lake views. High, medium or
                low-intensity exercise and leisure time can be spent at this
                beautiful park year-round.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another outdoor favorite is Zilker Park, a green space with over
                350 acres kept in pristine shape for public enjoyment. It’s no
                secret that Zilker is Austin’s best park, so it’s often busy and
                lively. For events, plays, festivals, and live music, the Emma
                Long Center is the city’s go-to venue.
