                Many areas throughout southern Texas are notorious for being
                pristine areas for affluent folks to plant their roots. Lake
                Austin is no exception, it is an area where lawyers, doctors,
                and other esteemed professionals have settled their families to
                expose them to the best that life has to offer

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                It’s virtually impossible to mention the surroundings of Lake
                Austin without suggesting a place to eat, and rightly so. Spend
                a morning at Ski Shores or Mozart’s Coffee enjoying their
                wonderful breakfast and brunch menus. Both are local favorites
                and offer beautiful views of the water. Should you be in the
                mood to try something new, Hula Hut is a jaw-dropping option for
                rare fusion cuisine. Polynesian flavors meld with traditional
                Tex-Mex cuisine to create dishes that locals have come to love.

              <p className="intr_tarry">
                The fun comes in many forms around Lake Austin. Once you’ve had
                your fill of fine dining and shopping, soak up some sun and
                breeze at one of the popular outdoor sites that exist around the
                lake. The Mount Bonnell Lookout over the Pennybacker Bridge is a
                great way to get outdoors and can be an excursion for ease if
                you’re looking to be leisurely. Mary Quinlan Park is a great
                spot for fishing, boating, camping, picnicking, or just enjoying
                the beautiful blue water views. Thanks to its size and
                popularity, it’s easy to find a spot to enjoy quiet or socialize
                to meet new people.
